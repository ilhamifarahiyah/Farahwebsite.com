<font  color="black" size="5" face="times new roman">I love to go to beach if I had any problem and want to refresh myself. Time on the beach increases my self-esteem and promotes relaxation. Other than that, beach can lowers stress because being in nature, a place that make I feel safe, can lower my blood pressure and stress hormone levels. Likewise, spending time at the beach can lessen anxiety and nervous system arousal, which is what makes I feel stressed and anxious.
